## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project I learned how to layout elements using CSS Grid. It was challenging at first because it required a different way of thinking about how elements should be placed.

Luckily, the `grid-template-areas` helps me layout these elements effectively.

I also learned how to use **media query** to create a responsive design for desktop and mobile.
