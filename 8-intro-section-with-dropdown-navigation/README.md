## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Tailwind CSS

### What I learned

In this project, I built a landing page that shows an intro section of a company called Snap. I built the project using HTML5, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript.

I gained more experience in using Tailwind CSS. For instance, with Tailwind CSS, I can create a hamburger menu, dropdown menu both on the desktop and mobile version, and how to style elements using Tailwind CSS.

I also learned more about JavaScript's event listener method. I implemented it to create a functionality when an element is clicked.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs - addEventListener()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener) - The MDN Web Docs always helps me refresh my memory of using certain functions and methods.
- [Tailwind CSS Docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) - The Tailwind Documentation is the go-to place for finding utilities I want to add to the project.
