## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Submit their email address using an `input` field
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say _"Whoops! It looks like you forgot to add your email"_
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say _"Please provide a valid email address"_

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Flexbox
- JavaScript
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Another DOM project that's quite fun and quite challenging. I learned a lot about CSS properties, such as using them to position the `error-msg` element.

I also learned about using media query in JavaScript. With that, I can set different functionality for the `error-msg` element when I click the **Notify Me** button.

### Continued development

Armed with this knowledge, I'll use it for my upcoming landing page project.

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools - Media Queries with JavaScript](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_media_queries.asp) - This resource helped me for understanding how to remove a functionality when the media query changes.
